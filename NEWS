Versioning
----------

Releases will be numbered with the following semantic versioning format:

<major>.<minor>.<patch>

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor
  and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor
  (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch


termco 0.3.0 -
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* `colo` returned list rather than string if a single term was passed.  Spotted
  by Steve Simpson.  See issue #12.

* `term_count` did not handle hierarchical `term.list` correctly do=ue to a
  reordering done by **data.table** (when `group.vars` not `= TRUE`).  This
  has been corrected.

* Column ordering was not respected by `print.term_count`.

NEW FEATURES

* `important_terms` added to compliment `frequent_terms` allowing tf-idf
  weighted terms to rise to the top.

* `collapse_tags` added to combine tags/columns from `term_count` object without
  stripping the `term_count` class and attributes.

MINOR FEATURES

* `plot_counts` picks up a `drop` argument to enable terms not found (if `x` is
  a `as_terms` object created from a `term_count` object) to be retained in the
  bar plot.  Suggested by Steve Simpson.  See issue #18.

IMPROVEMENTS

CHANGES


termco 0.2.0
----------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* `validate_model` and `assign_validation_task` added to allow for human
  assessment of how accurate a model is functioning.

CHANGES

* `probe_colo_list`,`probe_colo_plot_list`, & `probe_colo_plot` all use
  `search_term_collocations` under the hood rather than `search_term` + `
  frequent_terms`.


termco 0.1.0
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* `plot.term_count` did not properly handle weighting.  This has been fixed and
  allows for `"count"` as a choice.

* `search_term_which` (also `search_term`) did not treat te `and` argument
  correctly.  `and` was treated identical to the `not` argument.

NEW FEATURES

* `split_data` added for easy creation of training and testing data.

* `classification_project` added to make a classification modeling project
  template.

* `plot_cum_percent` added for cumulative percent plot of frequent terms.

* `probe_` family of functions added to easily make lists of function calls for
  exploration of the frequent terms in the context of the data.  Functions include:
  `probe_list`, `probe_colo_list`, `probe_colo_plot_list`, & `probe_colo_plot`.

* `hierarchical_coverage` added to allow exploration of the unique coverage of a
  text vector by a term after partitioning out the elements matched by previous
  terms.

* `tag_co_occurrence` added to explore tag co-occurrences.

* `search_term_collocations`   added as a conveinence wrapper for `search_term`
  + `frequent_terms`. (Thanks to Steve Simpson)


MINOR FEATURES

* `plot_freq` picks up a `size` argument.

IMPROVEMENTS

* `term_count` now can be used in a hierarchical fashion.  A list of regexes can
  be passed and counted and then a second (or more) pass can be taken wit a new
  set of regexes on only those rows/text elements that were left untagged
  (count `rowSums` is zero).  This is accomplished by passing a `list` of
  `list`s of regexes.  Thanks to Steve Simpson for suggesting this feature.


termco 0.0.1
----------------------------------------------------------------

This package is a small suite of functions used to count terms and substrings
  in strings.
